This project is a collective work of 6 people, individual commits can have been moderated and/or monitored by 2 or more people. It is a layered structure of database handling.

Presentation layer - ConsoleUI, handles all cin and cout logic, translates user input commands and sends them forward to the business logic layer.

Business logic layer - LegendService and Legend, takes in the translated user input commands from the Presentation layer and sends further instructions to the Data Access layer.

Data access layer - DataAccess, handles the opening, reading and writing requests to the source of data.

Data (source) - External source of information.

This program is a database that keeps basic information about famous computer scientists, computers and their relations. In the program the user has the options of listing any of the 3 lists (Scientists/Computers/Relations) with various different sorting. The user can add, and edit scientists, computers and relations and search for a specific entry in the database. If the user wants to know the answer to life, the universe and everything, type 42 in the commands menu.

Availible commands:

Menu (from start):

Please enter one of the following numbers:

[1] - To list all the computer scientists, computers or relations

[2] - To add a computer scientist,a computer or a relation

[3] - To find a computer scientist, computer or a relation from the list

[4] - This will edit a computer scientists, computer or a relation from the list    

[5] - To delete a relation                  

[6] - this will clear the screen     

[7] - This will quit the program                              


(if the user inputs "1" from main menu)

List:


Enter one of the following commands:

[1] - to list scientists  //Offers ways to sort the list of scientists

[2] - to list computers  //Offers ways to sort the list of computers

[3] - to list relations  //Offers ways to sort the list of relations


(if the user inputs "1" from the list menu)

List => Scientists:

How do you want to sort

[1] - Alphabetical order  //Lists scientists, sorted in alphabetical order

[2] - Gender order  //Lists scientists, sorted in order by gender

[3] - Year of birth order  //Lists scientists, sorted by birth year

[4] - Still alive order(those who are still alive appear first) //Lists scientists, sorted by still alive (bool value)

[5] - No particular sorting  //Lists scientists, sorted by the order of insertions


(if the user inputs "2" from the list menu)

List => Computers:

How do you want to sort

[1] - Alphabetical order //Lists computers, sorted in alphabetical order

[2] - Built year order //Lists computers, sorted in order by year built

[3] - Was built //Lists computers, sorted by was built (bool value)

[4] - Type of computer order //Lists computers, sorted by computer type

[5] - No particular sorting //Lists computers, sorted by the order of insertions


(if the user inputs "3" from the list menu)

Lists => Relations:

How do you want to sort

[1] - By scientist name //Lists relations, sorted in alphabetical order of scientists

[2] - By computer name //Lists computers, sorted in alphabetical order of computers

(if the user inputs "2" from the main menu)

Add:

Enter one of the following commands:

[1] - to add scientists  //Opens input options to add a scientist

[2] - to add computers  //Opens input options to add a computer

[3] - to add relations //Opens input options to add a relation

(if the user inputs "1" from the add menu)

Add => Scientists:

Input options:

Enter the name: John Doe ("John Doe" is a sample input - expects a string of undefined length)

Enter the gender (M/F): M ('M' is a sample input, non-case sensitive - expects a char of either 'm' or 'f')

Enter the year of birth (up to 4 digits): 1750 ("1750" is a sample input - expects a numeric value between 0 and current year)

Are they alive (y/n)? n ('n' is a sample input - expects a char value of either 'y' or 'n' (if y then the user is prompted with a followup question of death year))

Enter the year of death (up to 4 digits): 1800 ('1800' is a sample input - expects a numeric value between born and current year)

(if the user inputs "2" from the add menu)

Add => Computers:

Input options:

Enter the name: MeanMachine42 ("MeanMachine42" is a sample input - expects a string value name)

Was it built (y/n)? y ('y' is a sample input - expects a char value of either 'y' or 'n' (if y then the user is prompted with a followup question of build year))

Year of build (4 digits): 2015 ("2015" is a sample input - expects a numeric value of 0 to current year)

No.    Type

1      Mechanical

2      Electrical

3      Transistor

4      Electromechanical

5      Abstract machine

6      Add a computerType

Enter Computer Type(0-6): 5 ("5" is a sample input - expects a numeric value from 1-6 (size of list)).

(if the user inputs "3" from the add menu)

Add => Relations:

This options lists the scientists, user is expected to input a number from 1 - size of list. The input should indicate which scientist you want to link to a computer.

Then lists the computers, user is expected to input a number from 1 - size of list. The input should indicate which computer you want to link to a scientist.

(if the user inputs "3" from the main menu)

Find:

This option should be used if you wish to find an entry on the list of the entries in any of the 3 tables (scientits, computers, relations). 

The user is asked, which parameter should be searched for and provides an input (corresponding with data type). 


(if the user inputs "4" from the main menu)

Edit:

This option helps the user find an entry on one of the 3 tables (see find above). Then helps the user provide new entries to each of the parameters in each of the information fields (varies on which table is being edited - For list of expected inputs and parameters, see add/find). 

(if the user inputs "5" from the main menu)

Delete relation:

This option provides the user with a full list of all relations and is asked to delete one of the entries (by inserting it's index into the command line).

(if the user inputs "6" from the main menu)

Clear:

This option clears the console screen.

(if the user inputs "7" from the main menu)

Quit:

This option exits the program.
