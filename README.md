This project is a collective work of 6 people, individual commits can have been moderated and/or monitored by 2 or more people. It is a layered structure of database handling.

Presentation layer - ConsoleUI, handles all cin and cout logic, translates user input commands and sends them forward to the business logic layer.

Business logic layer - LegendService and Legend, takes in the translated user input commands from the Presentation layer and sends further instructions to the Data Access layer.

Data access layer - DataAccess, handles the opening, reading and writing requests to the source of data.

Data (source) - External source of information.

This program is a database that keeps basic information about famous computer scientists, computers and their relations. In the program the user has the options of listing any of the 3 lists (Scientists/Computers/Relations) with various different sorting. The user can add, and edit scientists, computers and relations and search for a specific entry in the database. If the user wants to know the answer to life, the universe and everything, type 42 in the commands menu.

Availible commands:

Menu (from start):

|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|Please enter one of the following numbers:                    |
|[1] - To list all the computer scientists or computers        |
|[2] - To add a computer scientist or a computer               |
|[3] - To find a computer scientist from the list or a computer|
|[4] - This will edit a computer scientists from the list      |
|[5] - To delete a relation                                    |
|[6] - this will clear the screen                              |
