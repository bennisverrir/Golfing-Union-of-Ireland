This project is a collective work of 6 people, individual commits can have been moderated and/or monitored by 2 or more people. It is a layered structure of database handling.

Presentation layer - ConsoleUI, handles all cin and cout logic, translates user input commands and sends them forward to the business logic layer.

Business logic layer - LegendService and Legend, takes in the translated user input commands from the Presentation layer and sends further instructions to the Data Access layer.

Data access layer - DataAccess, handles the opening, reading and writing requests to the source of data.

Data (source) - External source of information.

This program is a database that keeps basic information about famous computer scientists, computers and their relations.
